# Assignment 7

## Technical problems

I had some technical problems during installation of RabbitMQ:<br/>

- The docs for ubuntu installation had a long text and had many options how to install..<br/>
- That resultet in a lot of confusion, because the page had `<a>` tag links all over, which made you jump up and down the page.<br/>
- The "recommended" installation option had very little documentation, so I needed to pick the second one.<br/>
- I finally, after probably jumping around the page for 30 min, understood what i needed to do and got it installed and working.<br/>

The installation guide should be revised in terms of user friendliness.

## Code

The code for experiment 2-4 is under `rabbitmq/` i used Go as programming language.
