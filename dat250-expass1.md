# Assignment 1

## Technical problems

I had none technical problems during installation.<br/>
I run ubuntu, where I installed everything I didn't already have with [apt](https://ubuntu.com/server/docs).

## Validating the software development environment

I checked my git installation with

```
git --version

```

I checked my java installation with

```
java -version

```

I checked my maven installation with

```
mvn -version

```

I use IntelliJ as my IDE.

## Heroku

I followed the [heroku-tutorial](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-java) without any problems with the deployed result of the tutorial [here](https://hidden-brushlands-60427.herokuapp.com/)
